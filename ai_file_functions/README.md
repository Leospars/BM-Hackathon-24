#Functions to Implement (TODO:)

### Create TS backend server to
- [ ]  Accept file from student app and sumarize content and return chat response
- [ ]  Accept a request for recommended resources and return youtube video links and websites (use a tuned ai model)
- [ ]  Accept semantic search query from user and then use RAG using data stored in firebase or azure to evaluate and return the file location (use another tuned ai model)

- [ ]  Create a seperate server that updates the stored firebase or azure file content when changes are made to the google drive (this runs on sever-side)

### In Stuednt App
- [ ] set functions to send and recieve the responses client side
